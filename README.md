# RFuncs
This repository is composed by R functions adapted/developed by me in order to analyze some datasets I look at on a daily basis.

[ggfor:](ggfor.R) Function to produce 'ggforest' plots for 'coxme' objects
[gg_growthcurve:](gg_growthcurve.R) Function to plot the result from "SummarizeGrowthCurve" (Growthcurver package) using ggplot2
