# RFuncs
This repository is composed by R functions adapted/developed by me in order to analyze some datasets I look at on a daily basis.

[ggfor:](ggfor.R) Function to produce 'ggforest' plots for 'coxme' objects

[gg_growthcurve:](gg_growthcurve.R) Function to plot the result from "SummarizeGrowthCurve" (Growthcurver package) using ggplot2

[gg_growthcurve_plate:](gg_growthcurve_plate.R) Function to calculate & plot the growth curves, as well as save and plot the corresponding parameters. [Click here for the Help  Page](HelpFiles/gg_growthcurve_plate.md)
